# SDG7_Energy_Transition_Analysis  (In progress)

A comprehensive visualization project tracking global progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) through multidimensional analysis of energy systems.

## üåç Goal  
To analyze global and regional energy transition patterns through 10+ visualization techniques, identifying key drivers and obstacles in achieving SDG 7 targets by 2030.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**:  
  - `Matplotlib/Seaborn`: Temporal trend visualizations and small multiples  
  - `Plotly`: Interactive choropleth maps and 3D projections  
  - `Scikit-learn`: PCA/MDS/TSNE dimensionality reduction for energy metrics  
- **Data Sources**:  
  - [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) (8 primary datasets)  
  - [Kaggle's Global Sustainable Energy Index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy/data)  
- **Network Analysis**:  
  - `NetworkX` for SDG synergy relationships visualization
  - Radial, Kamada-Kawai, Fruchterman-Reingold Layout

## üìä Key Features  
- **Temporal Analysis**:  
  - 40-year energy mix trends across 6 regions  
  - Fossil fuel vs renewable adoption trajectories  
- **Geospatial Visualization**:  
  - Renewable penetration heatmaps (2022)  
  - Standard deviation analysis of national performance  
- **Multidimensional Insights**:  
  - PCA/MDS/t-SNE projections of energy development metrics  
  - Network analysis of SDG synergies  

## üìà Outcome  
Identified critical patterns including:  
- South America's exceptional **75% renewable electricity dominance**  (will conduct further investigation)
- Africa's persistent energy poverty (**881 TWh** total generation)
- ......

Findings presented through **15+ publication-quality visualizations**, revealing actionable insights for policymakers.
